	abstract = {{RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq) has become the widely preferred choice for surveying the genome-wide transcriptome complexity in many organisms. However, the broad adaptation of this methodology into the clinic still needs further evaluation of potential effect of sample preparation factors on its analytical reliability using patient samples. In this study, we examined the impact of three major sample preparation factors (i.e., {cDNA} library storage time, the quantity of input {RNA}, and cryopreservation of cell samples) on sequence biases, gene expression profiles, and enriched biological functions using {RNAs} isolated from primary B cell and {CD}4+ cell blood samples of healthy subjects. Our comprehensive comparison results suggested that different {cDNA} library storage time, quantity of input {RNA}, and cryopreservation of cell samples did not significantly alter gene transcriptional expression profiles generated by {RNA}-seq experiments. These findings shed new lights on the potential applications of {RNA}-seq technique to patient samples in a regular clinical setting.},

	abstract = {With the fast development of high-throughput sequencing technologies, a new generation of genome-wide gene expression measurements is under way. This is based on {mRNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq), which complements the already mature technology of microarrays, and is expected to overcome some of the latter’s disadvantages. These {RNA}-seq data pose new challenges, however, as strengths and weaknesses have yet to be fully identified. Ideally, Next (or Second) Generation Sequencing measures can be integrated for more comprehensive gene expression investigation to facilitate analysis of whole regulatory networks. At present, however, the nature of these data is not very well understood. In this paper we study three alternative gene expression time series datasets for the Drosophila melanogaster embryo development, in order to compare three measurement techniques: {RNA}-seq, single-channel and dual-channel microarrays. The aim is to study the state of the art for the three technologies, with a view of assessing overlapping features, data compatibility and integration potential, in the context of time series measurements. This involves using established tools for each of the three different technologies, and technical and biological replicates (for {RNA}-seq and microarrays, respectively), due to the limited availability of biological {RNA}-seq replicates for time series data. The approach consists of a sensitivity analysis for differential expression and clustering. In general, the {RNA}-seq dataset displayed highest sensitivity to differential expression. The single-channel data performed similarly for the differentially expressed genes common to gene sets considered. Cluster analysis was used to identify different features of the gene space for the three datasets, with higher similarities found for the {RNA}-seq and single-channel microarray dataset.},

	abstract = {Ultra-high-throughput sequencing is emerging as an attractive alternative to microarrays for genotyping, analysis of methylation patterns, and identification of transcription factor binding sites. Here, we describe an application of the Illumina sequencing (formerly Solexa sequencing) platform to study {mRNA} expression levels. Our goals were to estimate technical variance associated with Illumina sequencing in this context and to compare its ability to identify differentially expressed genes with existing array technologies. To do so, we estimated gene expression differences between liver and kidney {RNA} samples using multiple sequencing replicates, and compared the sequencing data to results obtained from Affymetrix arrays using the same {RNA} samples. We find that the Illumina sequencing data are highly replicable, with relatively little technical variation, and thus, for many purposes, it may suffice to sequence each {mRNA} sample only once (i.e., using one lane). The information in a single lane of Illumina sequencing data appears comparable to that in a single array in enabling identification of differentially expressed genes, while allowing for additional analyses such as detection of low-expressed genes, alternative splice variants, and novel transcripts. Based on our observations, we propose an empirical protocol and a statistical framework for the analysis of gene expression using ultra-high-throughput sequencing technology.},

	abstract = {{RNA} molecules start assembling into ribonucleoprotein ({RNP}) complexes during transcription. Dynamic {RNP} assembly, largely directed by cis-acting elements on the {RNA}, coordinates all processes in which the {RNA} is involved. To identify the sites bound by a specific {RNA}-binding protein on endogenous {RNAs}, cross-linking and immunoprecipitation ({CLIP}) and complementary, proximity-based methods have been developed. In this Primer, we discuss the main variants of these protein-centric methods and the strategies for their optimization and quality assessment, as well as {RNA}-centric methods that identify the protein partners of a specific {RNA}. We summarize the main challenges of computational {CLIP} data analysis, how to handle various sources of background and how to identify functionally relevant binding regions. We outline the various applications of {CLIP} and available databases for data sharing. We discuss the prospect of integrating data obtained by {CLIP} with complementary methods to gain a comprehensive view of {RNP} assembly and remodelling, unravel the spatial and temporal dynamics of {RNPs} in specific cell types and subcellular compartments and understand how defects in {RNPs} can lead to disease. Finally, we present open questions in the field and give directions for further development and applications.},

Other issues to consider in experimental design include the quality of the antibodies and the depth of sequencing.Genome alignment and the identification of enriched regions present challenges for data analysis, and there are several strategies available.Owing to increased genome coverage, a substantial fraction of the repetitive regions in the genome can now be examined.Increased sensitivity and specificity in the mapping of transcription factor binding sites has facilitated motif discovery and target identification.Detailed profiling of histone modifications and nucleosome positions enables greater understanding of epigenetic mechanisms in development and differentiation.As the cost of sequencing continues to decrease, {ChIP}–seq will be the method of choice over array-based approaches in nearly all cases.},

	abstract = {{RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-Seq) uses the capabilities of high-throughput sequencing methods to provide insight into the transcriptome of a cell. Compared to previous Sanger sequencing- and microarray-based methods, {RNA}-Seq provides far higher coverage and greater resolution of the dynamic nature of the transcriptome. Beyond quantifying gene expression, the data generated by {RNA}-Seq facilitate the discovery of novel transcripts, identification of alternatively spliced genes, and detection of allele-specific expression. Recent advances in the {RNA}-Seq workflow, from sample preparation to library construction to data analysis, have enabled researchers to further elucidate the functional complexity of the transcription. In addition to polyadenylated messenger {RNA} ({mRNA}) transcripts, {RNA}-Seq can be applied to investigate different populations of {RNA}, including total {RNA}, pre-{mRNA}, and noncoding {RNA}, such as {microRNA} and long {ncRNA}.
